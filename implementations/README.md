# Implementations that support Reactive

This chapter will cover three main implementations that support Reactive Programming principles: **Future and Promises**, **Actors** and **Reactive Extensions**. For each implementation will be given a general introduction and also a pragmatic example, that will put in practice the features of the specific implementation.

The examples will use Scala as host language and some specific library/toolkit.
