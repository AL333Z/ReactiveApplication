# Functional Reactive Programming

Functional reactive programming has its origin with *Fran* (Functional reactive animation), a Haskell library by Conal Elliott for interactive animations.
Fran's author found it difficult to express the *what* of an interactive animation abstracting from the *how* and built a set of expressive and recursive data types, combined with a declarative programming language.

Informally, **functional reactive programming** is a programming paradigm which brings a notion of **time** in the functional programming paradigm.
