# Reactive programming

When using the imperative programming paradigm, the act of capturing dynamic values is done only indirectly, through **state and mutations**. In this context, the idea of *dynamic/evolving* values is not a first class value in the paradigm. Moreover, the paradigm can only capture discrete evolving values, since the paradigm itself is *temporally discrete*.

This chapter will focus on **Functional Reactive Programming** and **Reactive Programming**, in an attempt to provide formal definitions.
