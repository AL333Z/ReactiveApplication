# Towards reactive event processing

The previous chapter depicted a possbile approach to apply RP techniques to the context of mobile applications development.

This chapter will instead introduce a possible application of RP principles and abstractions to a different context: **events processing**.

Event processing is a method of *tracking and analyzing* streams of information about things that happen, and *deriving* a conclusion from them.

Also in this chapter, to better understand and see how RP plays a foundamental role in the game, a use case will be introduced, discussed and solved.
