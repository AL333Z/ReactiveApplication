# Scala.React

**Scala.React** is a framework that has been introduced with the paper "Deprecating the Observer Pattern" from Maier, Odersky and Rompf. The key concepts around Scala.React originate in Elliot's FRP, and Scala.React aims to provide a **combinator-based approach for reactive programming**.

The paper depictes how the observer pattern should be considered an anti-pattern, since it violates a lot of software engineering principles such as encapsulation, composability, separation of concerns, scalability, uniformity, abstraction, semantic distance..

The authors aims to provide and depict an efficient use of object-oriented, functional, and data-flow programming principles to overcome the limitations of the existing approaches.

After many years from its presentation, the framework seems to be an academic library that can be neglectable in favor of the RxScala/RxJava library. For the author of this thesis, the paper is really meaningful in the context of this thesis, since it introduces a set of abstractions that are close to the original model of FRP from Elliot.
