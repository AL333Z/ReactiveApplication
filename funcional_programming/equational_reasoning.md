# Equational reasoning

The previous section introduced and depicted referential transparency. The importance of referential transparency expressions is that they make substitution model work and the substitution model helps **equational reasoning** work.

A possible definition of equational reasoning is *the process of interpreting code by substituting equals-for-equals*.

Equational reasoning is an important property, since it keeps the models easy to reason about and easy to validate. The correctenss of the properties of a model that respect equational reasoning can be verified just as the properties of a math theorem.
