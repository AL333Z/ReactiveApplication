# Patterns

The previous sections of this chapter introduced the basics of functional domain modelling, by using **algebraic data types**, and the importance of **referential transparency**.

This final section will go deeper, and cover three functional design pattern: **monoids**, **functors** and **monads**. These patterns are really important to fully understand the usage of algebraic data type to model the domain.

The pattern introduced in this section are *abstract*, meaning that they don't operate on just one specific data type bar on all data types that share a common algebra.
